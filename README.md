## My process
I started off creating an HTML base template. Then I mapped out each section into boxes for better visibility. After that, I worked on each section one by one, mirroring the example solution.

### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned
I learned more about how to use the BEM methodology and what is considered a block, element, or modifier. I also learned how to use google fonts and some good practices to do in css.

### Continued development
In the future, I would like to work on creating responsive websites. Currently for this template, if you change the dimensions, the website's layout gets destroyed. The solution would be to experiment with media queries to prevent this from happening. I will continue practicing the BEM methodology, but I may switch to a framework like Tailwind in the future. I would also like to use google fonts more. There's a lot of things I don't know (ie. for this website I can't use the light font for some reason.)
